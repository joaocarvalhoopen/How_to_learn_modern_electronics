# How to learn modern electronics
**A guide to the adventurer**<br>
First of all basic electronics can be simple to understand, but to understand it deeply and see were the rabbit hole goes you have to do some serious kind of study. The plan to enlightenment has multiple parallel path’s, but books, internet info, youtube video channels and good forums constitute the main pillars.<br>
<br>

## Books
I’m suggesting that you read the books from cover to cover and not only for reference.<br>
<br>
The first book that you should read is a cheap book but a very good one.<br>

Pag. 1050 <br>
<br>
Now that you know a little bit about what electronics is in the majority of the fields that are connected to electronic circuits, you should try to delve a little deeper in each subject.<br>

## Online Courses

### Embedded systems development courses

* **Learn ESP32 with Arduino IDE** <br>
  I took this course and I recommend it, because it is a good course. It's an extensive course, good for the beginner and not so beginners. It covers in many, many projects all the micro-controller programming and the IoT - Internet Of Things stuff with the Arduino IDE. The author is constantly adding material to the course. I have experience with several different micro-controllers and in my opinion, the ESP32 and the future ESP32-S02 are good safe bet's to learn micro-controllers in general and IoT in particular. Also they are low cost and have large range of advanced features. <br>

* **Learn ESP32 The ESP-IDF** <br>
  I took this course and I recommend it highly, this is an excellent course. This is a course for a more professional or more in depth persons, for the ones that really need to know what's under the hood and want to make use of every feature, capacity and possibility that the incredible ESP32 provides. The other kind of person that I can imagine doing this course is if you are already a developer for example in PC or web context, you will rapidly understand all the details and understand all the micro-controller power that the author explains to you. The framework used (ESP-IDF) is the one made by ExpressIF, the enterprise that makes the ESP32. The knowledge that you will obtain from this course is really profound, although the author goes to extensive length to explain the foundations that you need even in more advanced C programming, it is for people that already used a micro-controller before, be it a simple Arduino Uno board, or a more professional one. But I would like to say clearly that, the knowledge that you obtain from this course is profound. In my opinion it gives you the tools, it enables you to work professional on this field developing embedded systems software with the ESP32 including IoT. The course already as 12 hours, with all the code accessible in GitHub, but it's author is currently still adding content. It also includes advanced sections on freeRTOS. It uses in a very intelligent and useful way the free Visual Studio Code Editor in Windows and Linux, even allowing debugging in ESP32 inside Visual Studio Code with a cheap 10 dollars JTAG addon board. <br>

### PCB design courses

* **KiCAD like a Pro** <br>
  I took this course and reed the book and I recommend it highly, this is an excellent course. There comes a time that every person that enter this field of electronics or embedded systems, will feel the need to make a professional looking board for the system that you design. When breadboard, soldering wires or simples pre-fabricated modules connected by wires, are not enough. That is the time to start learning about how to design a PCB's. Starting by drawing the schematic, to the design of the effective PCB, reaching out to a fabric to make you PCB and then assemble in your home or in the fabric with an assembly service. This course cover it all. KiCAD is a free open source tool that is of professional grade. <br>
